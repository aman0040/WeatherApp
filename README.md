A beautiful and feature-rich weather app built using SwiftUI, allowing users to view weather details for different cities. The app displays current temperature, wind speed, humidity, UV index, and hourly forecasts, along with an interactive map.

## API Key Management

This app uses the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch weather data. Replace the placeholder API key in `WeatherViewModel` with your own API key.

1. Sign up for an API key from [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/).
2. Replace the `apiKey` variable in `WeatherViewModel.swift` with your API key:
   ```swift
   private let apiKey = "YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"
